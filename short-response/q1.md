# Question

When should Context be used?

# Answer

Context should be used to avoid prop drilling, which occurs when you need to pass a piece of state through multiple levels of child components before it reaches the component that actually uses it.

While passing state through a single intermediate component is manageable, passing it through two or more intermediate components can become tedious and redundant, especially when those intermediate components don't use the state themselves but just pass it down.

Context offers an alternative to prop drilling by allowing you to store global data that can be accessed by any component within the scope of that context. This makes it easier to manage and share state across different parts of your application without needing to pass it explicitly through multiple component layers.
