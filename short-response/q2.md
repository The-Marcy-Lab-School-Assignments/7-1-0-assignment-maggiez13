# Question

What are the steps to incorporating context into your application?

# Answer

There are three main steps to incorporating context:

1. Creating a Context object

```js
const Context = createContext(startingValue);
```

2. Rendering a Context Provider / Providing Context Values

   The `Context.Provider` component will wrap the part of the component tree that needs access to the context.

   The `value` prop will hold the data that is shared with components that consume this context.

```js
<Context.Provider values={values}>{children}</Context.Provider>
```

3. Getting ("consuming") values from a Context:

   In any component that needs the context value, use the `useContext` hook to consume the content.

```js
const contextValue = useContext(Context);
```
